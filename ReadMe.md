Kathmandu is one of the most polluted cities in South Asia. Most existing systems only show current pollution levels, leaving the public reactive. **Swaastha-Ktm** changes the narrative by predicting "Hazardous" air quality levels 24 hours in advance, giving schools, hospitals, and families a critical head start to prepare.

---

## Key Features

- **24-Hour Forecast:** Predicts if PM2.5 will reach hazardous levels (>150 µg/m³) tomorrow.
- **Closed-Loop Automation:** An hourly background scheduler fetches, cleans, and merges data from OpenAQ and Visual Crossing APIs.
- **Medical-Grade Data Cleaning:** Implements a rolling median filter to remove sensor noise and humidity-induced "fake spikes."
- **Kathmandu Context Features:** Models specific urban drivers like **Brick Kiln Seasonality** and **Office Rush Hours**.
- **Public Health Optimized:** Tuned with a **0.25 probability threshold** to achieve an **85% Hazard Catch Rate (Recall).**

## The Machine Learning Brain

The project leverages a 3-year historical dataset (Jan 2022 - Dec 2025). After extensive hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**, the **Voting Ensemble** emerged as the winning model.

### **Model Performance Leaderboard**

| Model                | Catch Rate (Recall) | Precision | Reliability (F1) |
| :------------------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :--------------- |
| **Voting Ensemble**  | **85%**             | **41%**   | **0.56**         |
| Single XGBoost       | 94%                 | 34%       | 0.50             |
| Single Random Forest | 25%                 | 56%       | 0.34             |

_We chose the Voting Ensemble because it provides the best "Guardian" behavior—sensitive enough to protect people while minimizing false alarms._

## The Swaastha-Ktm Dashboard

The UI is designed with a **Medical AQI Gauge** and **Health Prescriptions**, translating complex particulate math into actionable life-saving advice.

- **Green Scale:** Safe - Perfect for the morning commute.
- **Deep Maroon Scale:** Hazardous - Wear N95 masks; keep windows closed.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration:** Move from CSV history to **PostgreSQL** for better scalability.
- **Push Alerts:** Automated SMS/Email notifications when a 0.25 hazard probability is triggered.
- **Spatial Expansion:** Adding sensors from Patan, Bhaktapur, and Maharajgunj for valley-wide coverage.
